# Installation

ADToolbox is a python package that can be executed locally by installation, or by using the containerized version with Docker. Any function that relies on external tools can be executed either adding the external tool to the operating system's environment or using the Docker or Singularity containers. Also with utility functions provided, each function can be executed through slurm job scheduler to provide interface for running in cloud/high-performance computer clusers.
